We show that animals also play an important role by mediating carbon exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere, at times turning ecosystem carbon sources into sinks, or vice versa. Animals also move across landscapes, creating a dynamism that shapes landscape-scale variation in carbon exchange and storage. Predicting and measuring carbon cycling under such dynamism is an important scientific challenge. We explain how to link analyses of spatial ecosystem functioning, animal movement, and remote sensing of animal habitats with carbon dynamics across landscapes. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The end of free movement with the European Union also has “huge implications for science,” says Naomi Weir, deputy director of the Campaign for Science and Engineering in London, which advocates for a smooth and affordable research immigration system.

Dietary nutrients are essential not only for human health but also for the health and survival of the trillions of microbes that reside within the human intestines. Diet is a key component of the relationship between humans and their microbial residents; gut microbes use ingested nutrients for fundamental biological processes, and the metabolic outputs of those processes may have important impacts on human physiology. Studies in humans and animal models are beginning to unravel the underpinnings of this relationship, and increasing evidence suggests that it may underlie some of the broader effects of diet on human health and disease. © 2017 The Authors.",,"carbohydrate; food additive; prebiotic agent; short chain fatty acid; trace element; cardiovascular disease; diet; metabolism; microorganism; obesity; physiology; public health; bacterial metabolism; bacterial survival; Bifidobacterium; carbohydrate diet; carbohydrate metabolism; cardiovascular disease; diet; dietary intake; dietary pattern; dietary reference intake; dietary supplement; disease association; disease severity; energy resource; fat intake; fatty acid synthesis; health care; human; intestine flora; ketogenic diet; Lactobacillus; Mediterranean diet; metabolic disorder; microbiota targeted diet; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; nutrient management; obesity; paleolithic diet; priority journal; protein intake; Review; species composition; species richness; vegetarian diet; health; intestine flora; metabolism; physiology; Animalia; Diet; Diet, Ketogenic; Diet, Mediterranean; Diet, Paleolithic; Diet, Vegetarian; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Food Additives; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Health; Humans",,"Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Dietary Proteins; Food Additives",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Zeevi, D., (2015) Cell, 163, pp. 1079-1094; Mayer, J., (1972) Science, 176, pp. 237-241; Cotillard, A., (2013) Nature, 500, pp. 585-588; Herter, C.A., Kendall, A.I., (1910) J.

Recently, evidence for the adverse metabolic effects of processed carbohydrate has led to a resurgence in interest in lower-carbohydrate and ketogenic diets with high fat content. However, some argue that the relative quantity of dietary fat and carbohydrate has little relevance to health and that focus should instead be placed on which particular fat or carbohydrate sources are consumed. This review, by nutrition scientists with widely varying perspectives, summarizes existing evidence to identify areas of broad consensus amid ongoing controversy regarding macronutrients and chronic disease. © 2017 The Authors.",,"high density lipoprotein cholesterol; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; triacylglycerol; cancer; carbohydrate; cardiovascular disease; diabetes; diet; fat; metabolism; nutrition; obesity; body weight management; carbohydrate diet; carbohydrate intake; cardiometabolic risk; cardiovascular disease; chronic disease; consensus; diabetes mellitus; dietitian attitude; disorders of carbohydrate metabolism; fat intake; glucose intolerance; high density lipoprotein cholesterol level; human; insulin resistance; ketogenic diet; long term care; low carbohydrate diet; low density lipoprotein cholesterol level; macronutrient; malignant neoplasm; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; nutritional value; obesity; pancreas islet beta cell; patient compliance; physiology; priority journal; Review; triacylglycerol blood level; chronic disease; low fat diet; Chronic Disease; Diet, Fat-Restricted; Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats; Humans",,"Dietary Carbohydrates; Dietary Fats",,,"National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK: K24DK082730","D.S.L. was supported in part by a career award from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (K24DK082730).",,,,,,,,,,"(1977) Dietary Goals for The United States, , U.

Adjustment of meal size and frequency have emerged as powerful tools to ameliorate and postpone the onset of disease and delay aging, whereas periods of fasting, with or without reduced energy intake, can have profound health benefits. The underlying physiological processes involve periodic shifts of metabolic fuel sources, promotion of repair mechanisms, and the optimization of energy utilization for cellular and organismal health. Future research endeavors should be directed to the integration of a balanced nutritious diet with controlled meal size and patterns and periods of fasting to develop better strategies to prevent, postpone, and treat the socioeconomical burden of chronic diseases associated with aging. © 2017 The Authors.",,"disease incidence; fasting; food intake; health status; nutritional requirement; nutritional status; caloric intake; caloric restriction; circadian rhythm; diet; fasting; feeding behavior; food intake; human; incidence; intermittent fasting; lifespan; meal size; metabolism; nonhuman; nutrient content; nutrition; priority journal; Review; social status; survival; aging; chronic disease; diet; diet restriction; meal; portion size; Aging; Caloric Restriction; Chronic Disease; Diet; Fasting; Humans; Meals; Serving Size",,,,,,"We wish to thank L.

We dissect nutritional approaches to optimal performance, showcasing the contribution of modern sports science to gold medals and world titles. Despite an enduring belief in a single, superior “athletic diet,” diversity in sports nutrition practices among successful athletes arises from the specificity of the metabolic demands of different sports and the periodization of training and competition goals. Pragmatic implementation of nutrition strategies in real-world scenarios and the prioritization of important strategies when nutrition themes are in conflict add to this variation.

Contingency is what makes historical outcomes unpredictable. Unlike many other natural phenomena, evolution is a historical process. Evolutionary change is often driven by the deterministic force of natural selection, but natural selection works upon variation that arises unpredictably through time by random mutation, and even beneficial mutations can be lost by chance through genetic drift. Moreover, evolution has taken place within a planetary environment with a particular history of its own. This tension between determinism and contingency makes evolutionary biology a kind of hybrid between science and history. While philosophers of science examine the nuances of contingency, biologists have performed many empirical studies of evolutionary repeatability and contingency. Here, we review the experimental and comparative evidence from these studies. Replicate populations in evolutionary “replay” experiments often show parallel changes, especially in overall performance, although idiosyncratic outcomes show that the particulars of a lineage’s history can affect which of several evolutionary paths is taken. Comparative biologists have found many notable examples of convergent adaptation to similar conditions, but quantification of how frequently such convergence occurs is difficult. On balance, the evidence indicates that evolution tends to be surprisingly repeatable among closely related lineages, but disparate outcomes become more likely as the footprint of history grows deeper. Ongoing research on the structure of adaptive landscapes is providing additional insight into the interplay of fate and chance in the evolutionary process. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

We discuss how neural mechanisms identified in spatial navigation research operate across information domains to support a wide spectrum of cognitive functions. In our framework, place and grid cell population codes provide a representational format to map variable dimensions of cognitive spaces. This highly dynamic mapping system enables rapid reorganization of codes through remapping between orthogonal representations across behavioral contexts, yielding a multitude of stable cognitive spaces at different resolutions and hierarchical levels. Action sequences result in trajectories through cognitive space, which can be simulated via sequential coding in the hippocampus. In this way, the spatial representational format of the hippocampal formation has the capacity to support flexible cognition and behavior.",,"cell population; cognition; grid cell; hippocampus; human; human cell; human experiment; memory; review; simulation; spatial orientation; animal; brain mapping; cognition; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; physiology; thinking; Animals; Brain Mapping; Cognition; Hippocampus; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Spatial Navigation; Thinking",,,,,"Horizon 2020 Framework Programme, H2020: 724836",,,,,,,,,,,"Tolman, E.C., Cognitive maps in rats and men (1948) Psychol.

Biocomposites have attracted the attention of automakers for the design of lightweight parts. Hybrid biocomposites made of petrochemical-based and bioresourced materials have led to technological advances in manufacturing. Greener biocomposites from plant-derived fiber and crop-derived plastics with higher biobased content are continuously being developed. Biodegradable composites have shown potential for major uses in sustainable packaging. Recycled plastic materials originally destined for landfills can be redirected and repurposed for blending in composite applications, thus leading to reduced dependence on virgin petro-based materials. Studies on compatibility of recycled and waste materials with other components in composite structure for improved interface and better mechanical performance pose major scientific challenges. This research holds the promise of advancing a key global sustainability goal. 2017 © The Authors.",,"biofuel; lignocellulose; petrochemical agent; plastic; resin; biomaterial; biodegradation; chemical composition; chemical structure; equipment design; food processing; green chemistry; landfill; mechanics; packaging; priority journal; recycling; Review; technology; tensile strength; waste; bioremediation; chemistry; green chemistry; Biocompatible Materials; Biodegradation, Environmental; Green Chemistry Technology",,"lignocellulose, 11132-73-3; Biocompatible Materials",,,"Ontario Research Foundation, ORF: ORF-RE07; Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, NSERC; Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs, OMAFRA","This work is financially supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC)–Discovery Grants; the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs (OMAFRA), Canada/University of Guelph Bioeconomy for Industrial Uses Research Program; the Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and Competitive Green Technologies through AgriInnovation Program; and the Ontario Research Fund, Research Excellence Program, Round-7 (ORF-RE07) from the Ontario Ministry of Research, Innovation and Science (MRIS), Canada.",,,,,,,,,,"(2017) Nat.

Multifunctionality arises naturally from this structural complexity: An example is the combination of rigidity and flexibility in protein-based teeth of the squid sucker ring. Other examples are time-delayed actuation in plant seed pods triggered by environmental signals, such as fire and water, and surface nanostructures that combine light manipulation with mechanical protection or water repellency. Bioinspired engineering transfers some of these structural principles into technically more relevant base materials to obtain new, often unexpected combinations of material properties. Less appreciated is the huge potential of using bioinspired structural complexity to avoid unnecessary chemical diversity, enabling easier recycling and, thus, a more sustainable materials economy. 2017 © The Authors.",,"biomaterial; calcium carbonate; calcium phosphate; cellulose; chitin; collagen; hemicellulose; keratin; lignin; silicon dioxide; silk; tannin derivative; wax; carbohydrate; mineral; protein; animal shell; biocompatibility; biodegradability; biofouling; chemical composition; chemical structure; drug delivery system; encapsulation; nonhuman; particle size; plant seed; porosity; priority journal; Review; solubility; three dimensional printing; wing; bioengineering; chemistry; green chemistry; synthesis; Biocompatible Materials; Bioengineering; Green Chemistry Technology; Minerals; Proteins; Sugars",,"calcium carbonate, 13397-26-7, 13701-58-1, 14791-73-2, 471-34-1; calcium phosphate, 10103-46-5, 13767-12-9, 14358-97-5, 7758-87-4; cellulose, 61991-22-8, 68073-05-2, 9004-34-6; chitin, 1398-61-4; collagen, 9007-34-5; hemicellulose, 63100-39-0, 63100-40-3, 9034-32-6; lignin, 9005-53-2; silicon dioxide, 10279-57-9, 14464-46-1, 14808-60-7, 15468-32-3, 60676-86-0, 7631-86-9; wax, 83062-05-9; protein, 67254-75-5; Biocompatible Materials; Minerals; Proteins; Sugars",,,"Universität Salzburg","The authors are grateful for many discussions about active materials, particularly with W.

However, after nearly two decades of work in the area, questions remain about the practical impact of nanotube and graphene composites. This uncertainty stems from factors that include poor load transfer, interfacial engineering, dispersion, and viscosity-related issues that lead to processing challenges in such nanocomposites. Moreover, there has been little effort to identify selection rules for the use of nanotubes or graphene in composite matrices for specific applications. This review is a critical look at the status of composites for developing high-strength, low-density, high-conductivity materials with nanotubes or graphene. An outlook of the different approaches that can lead to practically useful nanotube and graphene composites is presented, pointing out the challenges and opportunities that exist in the field. 2017 © The Authors.",,"carbon nanotube; graphene; nanocomposite; chemical engineering; chemical modification; chemical parameters; chemical structure; conductance; density; dispersion; interfacial engineering; molecular mechanics; nanotechnology; physical parameters; priority journal; Raman spectrometry; Review; viscosity",,,,,"Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/K005014/1; National Research Foundation of Korea, NRF: 2018R1A2B2001565, 785219","We thank S.

Many new materials have been introduced since Michael Faraday's discovery of magnetic induction, when iron was the only option. However, as wide bandgap semiconductor devices become more common in both power electronics and motor controllers, there is an urgent need to further improve soft magnetic materials.These improvements will be necessary to realize the full potential in efficiency, size, weight, and power of high-frequency power electronics and high-rotational speed electrical machines. Here we provide an introduction to the field of soft magnetic materials and their implementation in power electronics and electrical machines. Additionally, we review the most promising choices available today and describe emerging approaches to create even better soft magnetic materials. © 2018 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Basic research should get an increasing share, Cao says. The current level of support “is not enough for China to become a scientific power.” Many are also wondering what a recent bureaucratic shake up will mean for science. This spring the National People’s Congress decided to merge the National Natural Science Foundation, which supported a large share of the country’s basic research efforts through competitive grants, into the Ministry of Science and Technology, which has managed nationally important big science projects.

When managed by using biodiversity-based techniques such as agroforestry, silvopasture, diversified farming, and ecosystem-based forest management, these socioeconomic systems can help maintain biodiversity and provide habitat connectivity, thereby complementing protected areas and providing greater resilience to climate change. Simultaneously, the use of these management techniques can improve yields and profitability more sustainably, enhancing livelihoods and food security. This approach to ""working lands conservation"" can create landscapes that work for nature and people. However, many socioeconomic challenges impede the uptake of biodiversity-based land management practices. Although improving voluntary incentives, market instruments, environmental regulations, and governance is essential to support working lands conservation, it is community action, social movements, and broad coalitions among citizens, businesses, nonprofits, and government agencies that have the power to transform how we manage land and protect the environment. © 2017 The Authors.",,"agricultural worker; agroforestry; biodiversity; climate change; food security; forest management; government; habitat; human; landscape; market; rangeland; review; agriculture; environmental protection; forest; forestry; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forestry; Forests; Humans",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Payne, J.L., Bush, A.M., Heim, N.A., Knope, M.L., McCauley, D.J., Ecological selectivity of the emerging mass extinction in the oceans (2016) Science, 353, pp. 1284-1286. , pmid: 27629258; Ceballos, G., Ehrlich, P.R., Dirzo, R., Biological annihilation via the ongoing sixth mass extinction signaled by vertebrate population losses and declines (2017) Proc.

Recent advances in our understanding of immune cell ontogeny have revealed a notable interplay between neurons and microglia during the prenatal and postnatal emergence of functional circuits. This Review focuses on the brain, where the early symbiotic relationship between microglia and neuronal cells critically regulates wiring, contributes to sex-specific differences in neural circuits, and relays crucial information from the periphery, including signals derived from the microbiota. These observations underscore the importance of studying neurodevelopment as part of a broader framework that considers nervous system interactions with microglia in a whole-body context. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Recent research indicates that although these extant amniotes possess a variety of divergent and nonhomologous pallial structures, they share a conserved set of neuronal cell types and circuitries. These findings suggest a principle of brain evolution: that natural selection preferentially preserves the integrity of information-processing pathways, whereas other levels of biological organization, such as the three-dimensional architectures of neuronal assemblies, are less constrained. We review the similarities of pallial neuronal cell types in amniotes, delineate candidate gene regulatory networks for their cellular identities, and propose a model of developmental evolution for the divergence of amniote pallial structures. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Here we provide an overview of how the diverse and dynamic functions of glial cells orchestrate essentially all aspects of nervous system formation and function. Radial glia, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells, oligodendrocytes, and microglia each influence nervous system development, from neuronal birth, migration, axon specification, and growth through circuit assembly and synaptogenesis. As neural circuits mature, distinct glia fulfill key roles in synaptic communication, plasticity, homeostasis, and network-level activity through dynamic monitoring and alteration of CNS structure and function. Continued elucidation of glial cell biology, and the dynamic interactions of neurons and glia, will enrich our understanding of nervous system formation, health, and function. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Invertebrates and vertebrates appear to share common developmental principles of neuronal specification in which cascades of transcription factors temporally pattern progenitors, while spatial cues modify the outcomes of this temporal patterning. Here, we highlight these conserved mechanisms and describe how they are used in distinct neural structures. We present the questions that remain for a better understanding of neuronal specification. Single-cell RNA profiling approaches will potentially shed light on these questions, allowing not only the characterization of neuronal diversity in adult brains, but also the investigation of the developmental trajectories leading to the generation and maintenance of this diversity. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

However, the speed and flexibility of this approach are limited, because modified chromosomes must be vertically inherited from one generation to the next. In an effort to remove this limitation, an ongoing research program funded by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) aims to disperse infectious genetically modified viruses that have been engineered to edit crop chromosomes directly in fields. This is genetic engineering through horizontal transfer, as opposed to vertical inheritance. The regulatory, biological, economic, and societal implications research contracts (2–4). In July 2017, the first of three consortia announced that they had been awarded a contract from DARPA to develop systems for insect dispersion of genetically modified viruses (2–4). These are contracts for completion of a 4-year work plan (1) that will culminate in large-scale greenhouse demonstrations of the fully functional insect-dispersed HEGAA approach. Maize and tomato plants are reportedly being used in current experiments (2–4), while dispersal insect species mentioned include leafhoppers, whiteflies, and aphids (3, 5).",,,,,,,,,,"(2016) Broad Agency Announcement Insect Allies Biological Technologies Office, , www.fbo.gov/utils/view?id=40638c9e7d45ed8310f9d4f4671b4a7b, HR001117S0002, 1 November; (2017) Insect Allies, , www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-07/btibrd072717.php, BTI receives DARPA Award.

Chromatin plays a key role in determining cellular state, whether totipotent, pluripotent, multipotent, or differentiated. We highlight chromatin dynamics involved in the generation of pluripotent stem cells as well as their influence on cell fate decision and reprogramming. We focus on the capacity of histone variants, chaperones, modifications, and heterochromatin factors to influence cell identity and its plasticity.

They typically integrate multiple signals and regulatory determinants to achieve precise spatiotemporal expression. Such enhancers can map quite far—one megabase or more—from the genes they regulate. How remote enhancers relay regulatory information to their target promoters is one of the central mysteries of genome organization and function. A variety of contrasting mechanisms have been proposed over the years, including enhancer tracking, linking, looping, and mobilization to transcription factories. We argue that extreme versions of these mechanisms cannot account for the transcriptional dynamics and precision seen in living cells, tissues, and embryos.

However, whole-genome analysis of 5mC reveals widespread tissue- and cell type–specific patterns and pervasive dynamics during mammalian development. Here we review recent findings that delineate 5mC functions in developmental stages and diverse genomic compartments as well as discuss the molecular mechanisms that connect transcriptional regulation and 5mC. Beyond the newly appreciated dynamics, regulatory roles for 5mC have been suggested in new biological contexts, such as learning and memory or aging. The use of new single-cell measurement techniques and precise editing tools will enable functional analyses of 5mC in gene expression, clarifying its role in various biological processes. © 2017 The Authors.",,"5 methylcytosine; CRISPR associated endonuclease Cas9; cytosine; dioxygenase; DNA methyltransferase 3A; DNA methyltransferase 3B; histone H3; methyl CpG binding protein 2; RE1 silencing transcription factor; ten eleven translocation methylcytosine dioxygenase; transcription activator like effector; transcription factor; transcription factor CTCF; unclassified drug; zinc finger protein; 5 methylcytosine; transcription factor; biology; detection method; developmental biology; DNA; gene expression; genome; mammal; methylation; aging; developmental stage; DNA methylation; gene editing; gene expression; genetic transcription; genomics; human; hydroxymethylation; learning; memory; methylation; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; sequence analysis; single cell bisulfite sequencing; single cell reduced representation bisulfite sequencing; transcription regulation; animal; diseases; gene expression regulation; genetics; memory; metabolism; neoplasm; single cell analysis; Mammalia; 5-Methylcytosine; Aging; Animals; Disease; DNA Methylation; Gene Editing; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Humans; Memory; Neoplasms; Single-Cell Analysis; Transcription Factors; Transcription, Genetic",,"5 methylcytosine, 554-01-8; CRISPR associated endonuclease Cas9; cytosine, 71-30-7; dioxygenase, 37292-90-3; esterase; 5-Methylcytosine; Transcription Factors",,,"National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of Mental Health, NIMH: R01MH112763, R21MH112161, U19MH114830, U19MH114831; National Human Genome Research Institute, NHGRI: R21HG009274; National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, NIDDK: U24DK112348; National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, NIEHS: R01ES025585; H2020 European Research Council, ERC: ERC-CoG-648879; Medical Research Council, MRC: MC_U120092689; Naval Research Board, NRB: N00014-16-1-3159; Medical Research Council Canada, MRC: MC_US_A652_5PY70","We apologize to those colleagues whose work we could not cite owing to space limitations.

This Review will largely focus on bacterial antagonism mediated by ribosomally synthesized peptides and proteins produced by members of host-associated microbial communities. We discuss recent findings on their diversity, functions, and ecological impacts. These systems play key roles in ecosystem defense, pathogen invasion, spatial segregation, and diversity but also confer indirect gains to the aggressor from products released by killed cells. Investigations into antagonistic bacterial interactions are important for our understanding of how the microbiota establish within hosts, influence health and disease, and offer insights into potential translational applications. 2017 © The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"bacteriocin; polymorphic toxin; polypeptide antibiotic agent; unclassified drug; bacterial toxin; antagonism; bacterium; cell; ecological impact; long-term change; microbial community; peptide; protein; antibiosis; antibiotic resistance; biological therapy; cell killing; cytolysis; experimental model; health promotion; host pathogen interaction; human; in vivo study; mathematical model; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; organism community; priority journal; protein structure; Review; species invasion; target cell; transgenic microorganism; treatment failure; type IV secretion system; type V secretion system; type VI secretion system; type VII secretion system; animal; bacterial infection; bacterial secretion system; Bacteroides; intestine flora; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; organismal interaction; physiology; symbiosis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Animals; Bacterial Infections; Bacterial Secretion Systems; Bacterial Toxins; Bacteroides; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Humans; Microbial Interactions; Microbiota; Symbiosis",,"bacteriocin, 11047-01-1; Bacterial Secretion Systems; Bacterial Toxins",,,"National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID: R01AI093771, R01AI120633","We thank M.

Despite these advances, their limited stability and need to prove upscaling remain crucial hurdles on the path to commercialization. We summarize recent advances toward commercially viable PSCs and discuss challenges that remain. We expound the development of standardized protocols to distinguish intrinsic and extrinsic degradation factors in perovskites. We review accelerated aging tests in both cells and modules and discuss the prediction of lifetimes on the basis of degradation kinetics. Mature photovoltaic solutions, which have demonstrated excellent long-term stability in field applications, offer the perovskite community valuable insights into clearing the hurdles to commercialization. 2017 © The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"perovskite; commercialization; degradation; efficiency measurement; energy efficiency; fuel cell; perovskite; photovoltaic system; reaction kinetics; testing method; commercial phenomena; illumination; irradiation; lead poisoning; molecular stability; priority journal; Review; temperature measurement; ultraviolet radiation",,"perovskite, 12194-71-7, 61027-03-0",,,"Office of Naval Research, ONR: N00014-17-1-2524; National Natural Science Foundation of China, NSFC: 21702069, 51502141, 61474049, 91433203, 91733301; Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology, UNIST: 1.180043.01; Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China, MOST: 2015AA034601; Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek, NWO","We thank the reviewers—in particular, one referee who drew our attention to the matter of potential-induced degradation—for constructive feedback.

Since their conception, super-resolution imaging methods have continually evolved and can now be used to image cellular structures in three dimensions, multiple colors, and living systems with nanometer-scale resolution. These methods have been applied to answer questions involving the organization, interaction, stoichiometry, and dynamics of individual molecular building blocks and their integration into functional machineries in cells and tissues. In this Review, we provide an overview of super-resolution methods, their state-of-the-art capabilities, and their constantly expanding applications to biology, with a focus on the latter.We will also describe the current technical challenges and future advances anticipated in super-resolution imaging. 2017 © The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"biology; microscopy; review; animal; cells; fluorescence microscopy; human; molecular imaging; nerve cell; procedures; synapse; three dimensional imaging; ultrastructure; Animals; Cells; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Molecular Imaging; Neurons; Synapses",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Hell, S.W., Wichmann, J., (1994) Opt.

RNA-guided Cas enzymes have been adopted as tools to manipulate the genomes of cultured cells, animals, and plants, accelerating the pace of fundamental research and enabling clinical and agricultural breakthroughs.We describe the basic mechanisms that set the CRISPR-Cas toolkit apart fromother programmable gene-editing technologies, highlighting the diverse and naturally evolved systems now functionalized as biotechnologies.We discuss the rapidly evolving landscape of CRISPR-Cas applications, fromgene editing to transcriptional regulation, imaging, and diagnostics. Continuing functional dissection and an expanding landscape of applications position CRISPR-Cas tools at the cutting edge of nucleic acid manipulation that is rewriting biology. 2017 © The Authors, some rights reserved;.",,"CRISPR associated protein; bacterial protein; Cas9 endonuclease Streptococcus pyogenes; DNA; endonuclease; guide RNA; RNA; biotechnological procedures; CRISPR Cas system; CRISPR-CAS9 system; diagnostic imaging; DNA modification; gene editing; gene targeting; genetic engineering; genetic manipulation; genetic variability; human; nonhuman; nucleic acid analysis; priority journal; Review; transcription regulation; animal; chemistry; genetic engineering; genetic transcription; genetics; metabolism; molecular imaging; plant; procedures; trends; Animals; Bacterial Proteins; CRISPR-Cas Systems; DNA; Endonucleases; Gene Editing; Genetic Engineering; Humans; Molecular Imaging; Plants; RNA; RNA, Guide; Transcription, Genetic",,"DNA, 9007-49-2; endonuclease, 9055-11-2; RNA, 63231-63-0; Bacterial Proteins; Cas9 endonuclease Streptococcus pyogenes; DNA; Endonucleases; RNA; RNA, Guide",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jasin, M., Rothstein, R., (2013) Cold Spring Harb.

The recent surge in quantum-inspired imaging sensors, together with a new wave of algorithms allowing on-chip, scalable and robust data processing, has induced an increase of activity with notable results in the domain of low-light flux imaging and sensing. We provide an overview of the major challenges encountered in low-illumination (e.g., ultrafast) imaging and how these problems have recently been addressed for imaging applications in extreme conditions. These methods provide examples of the future imaging solutions to be developed, for which the best results are expected to arise from an efficient codesign of the sensors and data analysis tools. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Underlying these recent advances has been the observation of temporal dissipative Kerr solitons in microresonators, which represent self-enforcing, stationary, and localized solutions of a damped, driven, and detuned nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which was first introduced to describe spatial self-organization phenomena. The generation of dissipative Kerr solitons provide a mechanism by which coherent optical combs with bandwidth exceeding one octave can be synthesized and have given rise to a host of phenomena, such as the Stokes soliton, soliton crystals, soliton switching, or dispersive waves. Soliton microcombs are compact, are compatible with wafer-scale processing, operate at low power, can operate with gigahertz to terahertz line spacing, and can enable the implementation of frequency combs in remote and mobile environments outside the laboratory environment, on Earth, airborne, or in outer space. © 2017 The Authors.",,"calibration; dissipation; equation; optical method; parameterization; spectrometer; astrophysical spectrometer; calibration; chaotic to low phase noise; complementary metal oxide semiconductor; counterpropagating soliton; dispersion; dissipative Kerr soliton; dual comb spectroscopy; information processing; light detection and ranging; light scattering; microwave to optical link; noise; nonlinear Schrodinger equation; nonlinear system; numerical simulation; optical microresonator; photonic chip; physics; priority journal; pump laser; Raman effect; Review; simulation; spatial multiplexing of soliton; spectroscopy; Stokes soliton; theoretical model; thermal nonlinearity; waveform",,,,,"Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, DARPA; Defense Sciences Office, DARPA, DSO, DARPA: 4000116145/16/ NL/MH/GM, HR0011-15-C-0055, W31P4Q-14-C-0050, W31P4Q-16-1-0002; Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung, SNF: 176563, FA9550-15-1-0099, FA9550-15-1-0303, RFMEFI58516X0005","This material is based on work supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), Defense Sciences Office (DSO) and (MTO), grants HR0011-15-C-0055 (DODOS), W31P4Q-16-1-0002 (SCOUT), and W31P4Q-14-C-0050 (PULSE); The European Space Technology Centre with ESA (4000116145/16/ NL/MH/GM); the Swiss National Science Foundation via BRIDGE (176563); a Swiss National Science Foundation Grant and Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation (project RFMEFI58516X0005); and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, Air Force Material Command, USAF under awards FA9550-15-1-0099 and FA9550-15-1-0303.",,,,,,,,,,"Zabusky, N.J., Kruskal, M.D., Interaction of “solitons” in a collisionless plasma and the recurrence of initial states (1965) Phys.

These properties are of interest from the point of view of applications but are hard to treat theoretically, as they result from multiple competing energy scales. Although possible in more weakly correlated materials, theoretical design and spectroscopy of strongly correlated electron materials have been a difficult challenge for many years. By treating all the relevant energy scales with sufficient accuracy, complementary advances in Green's functions and quantum Monte Carlo methods open a path to first-principles computational property predictions in this class of materials. 2017 © The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"correlation; electron; Monte Carlo analysis; prediction; superconductivity; theoretical study; Monte Carlo method; prediction; review; spectroscopy; superconductivity; theoretical study",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Head-Gordon, M., Artacho, E., (2008) Phys.

Techniques for biomolecular simulations have undergone substantial developments, and their accuracy and scope have expanded considerably. Progress has been made through an increasingly tight integration of experiments and simulations, with experiments being used to refine simulations and simulations used to interpret experiments. Here we review the underpinnings of this progress, including methods for more efficient conformational sampling, accuracy of the physical models used, and theoretical approaches to integrate experiments and simulations.

In this context, exploring completely the large space of potential materials is computationally intractable. Here, we review methods for achieving inverse design, which aims to discover tailored materials from the starting point of a particular desired functionality. Recent advances from the rapidly growing field of artificial intelligence, mostly from the subfield of machine learning, have resulted in a fertile exchange of ideas, where approaches to inverse molecular design are being proposed and employed at a rapid pace. Among these, deep generativemodels have been applied to numerous classes of materials: rational design of prospective drugs, synthetic routes to organic compounds, and optimization of photovoltaics and redox flow batteries, as well as a variety of other solid-state materials. 2017 © The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"drug; organic compound; artificial intelligence; design method; equipment; machine learning; model; molecular analysis; optimization; organic compound; photovoltaic system; redox conditions; technological development; artificial intelligence; bioengineering; machine learning; molecular model; priority journal; Review; solid state",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2015) 21st Century Challenges, , https://21stcenturychallenges.org/challenges/, Royal Geographical Society; Segal, D., (2017) Materials for the 21st Century, , Oxford Univ.

More recently, she has focused on soil and water quality and their connection to the region’s food and water security. An example of rising concerns about water security has emerged from the once-considered-secure resting place for some 237,000 tons of highly toxic arsenic trioxide dust produced by the now-abandoned Giant Mine, a gold-mining facility that operated in Yellowknife, capital of the Northwest Territories, from 1948 until 2004. It had no pollution controls in its first 3 years of operation. Some 16,500 pounds of toxic dust a day spewed out of the smelters until 1953, settling on lakes and atop the area’s terrain, according to a research report funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada. Eventually, the toxic debris was captured and buried in storage chambers and underground rocky spaces from which gold was once extracted. The debris stockpiles have become unstable and threaten Yellowknife’s groundwater supply. A remediation plan to freeze the stored toxic waste is being pursued after years of scientific examination. Turetsky’s work in both the research and public discussion of these issues demonstrates the range of challenges being addressed by AAAS Leshner Leadership Institute fellows, current and past, and the increasing need for effective engagement between scientists and the public.",,,,,,,,,,,"Hoy, A.Q.",,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,,"English","Sci.",Note,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050906295

VHL is the substrate recognition component of an E3 ubiqutin ligase complex that targets prolyl-hydroxylated proteins for proteasomal degradation (1). The canonical targets of VHL are the α subunits of hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs), which are oxygen-labile transcription factors that become constitutively stabilized early in ccRCC development and consequently direct transcriptional programs that promote angiogenesis and rewiring of intracellular metabolism (2–4). Identifying VHL substrates other than HIFαs that escape degradation and contribute to tumorigenesis could represent a new therapeutic approach for ccRCC. On page 290 of this issue, Zhang et al. (5) demonstrate that the transcription factor zinc fingers and homeoboxes 2 (ZHX2) is a previously unidentified VHL target that promotes ccRCC tumorigenesis through regulation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling, potentially identifying targets to treat ccRCC. © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"cyclin dependent kinase; immunoglobulin enhancer binding protein; mitogen activated protein kinase; transcription factor; transcription factor ZHX2; transcriptome; unclassified drug; biodegradation; cancer; cell; cell component; enzyme; enzyme activity; gene; gene expression; metabolism; protein; RNA; tumor; cancer cell culture; cancer growth; cancer survival; carcinogenesis; cell cycle progression; cell proliferation; disease course; gene expression; gene function; gene identification; gene overexpression; gene targeting; genetic transcription; human; kidney cancer; kidney tissue; nonhuman; priority journal; protein analysis; protein DNA binding; protein expression; protein modification; protein motif; protein stability; renal clear cell carcinoma cell line; Review; signal transduction; tumor growth; tumor microenvironment; tumor promotion; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; kidney; kidney tumor; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Kidney; Kidney Neoplasms; Transcription, Genetic",,"cyclin dependent kinase, 150428-23-2; mitogen activated protein kinase, 142243-02-5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Kaelin, W.G., Jr., (2017) Trans.

In the United States, investigators spend a considerable portion of their time on federally funded research engaged in associated administrative tasks (7). This takes time and effort away from research and can serve as a disincentive to seek grants or enter the field. Congress aimed to increase the efficiency of the federal investment in research and development and to reduce administrative burden on federally funded scientists through provisions of the 21st Century Cures Act (Cures Act, 13 December 2016) and the American Innovation and Competitiveness Act (AICA, 7 January 2017) (8, 9). Addressing research regulatory burden in law and associated oversight may provide the relief that reports and recommendations alone have not generated. But more than a year and a half after enactment of these laws, under an administration that has eagerly expressed intent to reduce regulations and associated costs, we see limited progress, transparency, and engagement with the research institutions that accept federal awards. Here, we focus on U.S. efforts to address research regulatory reform and allow for more direct engagement by the stakeholder community in the regulatory process, similar to the efforts of other nations and the European Union (EU). © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"competitiveness; European Union; federal system; investment; regulatory framework; research; research and development; research institution; stakeholder; awards and prizes; European Union; human; investment; review; scientist; United States",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF","burden associated with financial monitoring of subrecipients (other institutions or entities formally engaged in the research), including possible exemption from monitoring where subrecipients are subject to annual audit by federal regulations.

Recommended reforms put forward by the community for financial reporting more broadly have included elimination of the Federal Cash Transaction Report (FCTR), a quarterly report that is redundant under the modernized system because financial information on individual grants is available in real time. Although the FCTR was voluntarily eliminated by the National Science Foundation (NSF) for this reason, HHS has not made this change.

For example, the ability of neurons to receive, process, and transmit information depends on their polarized organization into axons and dendrites. The cytoskeleton and associated motor proteins shape cells and establish spatial organization. Microtubules (MTs) and actin are core components of the cytoskeleton and are assembled through head-to-tail polymerization of α- and β-tubulin heterodimers and actin monomers, respectively, resulting in asymmetric, polarized polymers with two different ends, called plus and minus ends. The spatially regulated polymerization of MTs and actin can drive morphological transitions, such as local protrusion of the plasma membrane, to drive cell migration or the development of specialized extensions, such as axons or dendrites and their branches. In addition, the structural asymmetry of MTs and actin enables cytoskeletal motor proteins (myosin, kinesin, and dynein) to walk toward a specific end of the fibers. Given the extreme dimensions and functional compartmentalization of neurons, such active transport is critical to sort and distribute cellular cargoes. Recent studies have used advanced microscopy to reveal how the cytoskeleton takes many different forms to facilitate local functions in neurons (see the figure). © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"actin; alpha tubulin; beta tubulin; molecular motor; asymmetry; cell component; compartmentalization; microscopy; nervous system; polymerization; protein; actin filament; axon; axon initial segment; biodiversity; cell compartmentalization; cell function; cell maturation; cell membrane; cell migration; cell shape; cell structure; cytoskeleton; dendrite; intracellular transport; microtubule; nerve cell; neurite outgrowth; priority journal; protein processing; Review; animal; cytology; human; nerve cell; physiology; polymerization; ultrastructure; Actin Cytoskeleton; Animals; Humans; Microtubules; Neurons; Polymerization",,"alpha tubulin, 78769-62-7; beta tubulin, 87090-36-6",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Xu, K., (2013) Science, 339, p. 452; Leterrier, C., (2017) Nat.

Along with pets and humans, houseplants are ubiquitous members in interior “megabiomes” (macroscopic home inhabitants). The numerous benefits of greenery in the built environment include metabolizing human respiratory products (carbon dioxide) and increasing oxygen concentrations. But, houseplants could do so much more. During the past decade, a realization has emerged that building interiors house far more than megabiomes and inanimate objects. The immense built environment—0.5% of terrestrial livable Earth—is an evolving microbiome incubator (1). Analogous to the gut microbiome, in which the gastrointestinal environment shapes the ecology of the microbial community therein, the built environment plays an important role in shaping the evolution and ecology of the home interior microbiome, and burgeoning research is characterizing its components as well as the forces of its evolution (1). Microbiomes are not typically part of interior design per se, but they could be more explicitly considered during architectural and interior designs (2). It has become clear that many factors play a role in interior microbiome ecology and evolution: climate and the human occupants themselves, as well as ventilation regimes, antibiotics, and pesticides, along with catastrophes, such as fires and floods (3). Here, we assess the feasibility of building new microbiome sensing and reporting capabilities into houseplants through synthetic biology approaches. In addition, we suggest how to incorporate these plants into interior designs to benefit human occupants. © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"carbon dioxide; oxygen; volatile organic compound; digestive system; equipment; esthetics; health monitoring; microbial community; plant; architecture; bacterial strain; bioinformatics; environmental health; environmental monitoring; gene expression; houseplant; human; microbial community; microbiome; nonhuman; priority journal; reporter gene; Review; synthetic biology; transgenic plant; virus detection; Arabidopsis; DNA damage; environmental monitoring; genetic procedures; genetics; health; microflora; mutation; procedures; Arabidopsis; Biosensing Techniques; DNA Damage; Environmental Monitoring; Health; Humans; Microbiota; Mutation; Plants, Genetically Modified",,"carbon dioxide, 124-38-9, 58561-67-4; oxygen, 7782-44-7",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"(2015) Trends Ecol.

However, their widespread use has led to the presence of many different chemicals in the water cycle (1, 2), from which they may enter the food chain (3, 4). The use of chemicals will further increase with growth, health, age, and living standard of the human population. At the same time, the need for clean water will also increase, including treated wastewater for food production and high-purity water for manufacturing electronics and pharmaceuticals.

The particle was a neutrino, electrically neutral and almost massless, whose path could be traced directly back to the violent cosmic events that created it. Cued by IceCube, the Antarctic detector, an orbiting telescope found that the neutrino likely came from a distant blazar, a bright source of radiation powered by a supermassive black hole. The new finding could mark the founding event of so-called neutrino astronomy and also triggered a powerful example of another new trend, multimessenger astronomy, in which telescopes studied the flaring blazar across electromagnetic spectrum, from gamma rays to radio waves. And if the result holds up, the neutrino-producing blazar could also help solve a decades-old mystery in astronomy: Where do the extremely high energy protons and other nuclei that occasionally bombard Earth come from? 2017 © The Authors, some rights reserved",,"ice; astronomy; detection method; extraterrestrial matter; ice; solar radiation; astronomy; light; neutrino; physics; priority journal; Short Survey",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,"30002231","English","Sci.",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050818441

One set of such suboptimal decisions are cognitive biases, wherein individuals make decisions that predictably violate rationality or their own best interests without a logical reason for doing so (4). One such bias is the sunk cost bias, in which individuals invest more time or resources in an outcome than it is worth given the potential gain, presumably because they focus on hindsight evaluation of irrecoverable costs rather than prospective gains (5).

The bacterial integral membrane protein bacteriorhodopsin (bR) uses retinal as its chromophore (see the figure), capturing the energy in a photon to drive retinal isomerization and pump protons across the membrane. bR is a readily accessible analog to the visual rhodopsins in, for example, the human eye.

The Danish physiologist discovered the enzyme known as the sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na ,K -ATPase), or sodium-potassium pump, which exports sodium ions from and imports potassium ions into cells. Almost all modern biochemistry, cell biology, and physiology textbooks showcase the sodium-potassium pump, which accounts for about 20 to 30% of the energy used by cells through hydrolysis of ATP in human and animal bodies and up to 70 to 80% in the brain. In recognition of this first discovery of an ion-transporting ATPase, Skou shared the 1997 Nobel Prize in Chemistry with chemists Paul D. Boyer and John E.

The idea—inspired by the success of smallpox eradication in the 1960s and 1970s—is that a large scale, but time-limited, effort could eliminate a disease for all successive generations, resulting in an enormous payoff both financially and in improved health.

Gene drives, which have worked in insect experiments done in laboratories, have received intense scrutiny because some researchers hope to use them in the wild to eliminate disease-causing or crop-destroying pests, but this experiment sidestepped the controversy by focusing on creating a simpler way to genetically alter traits in lab mice. The team from the University of California, San Diego, used the genome editor CRISPR to put a gene in the mice that modifies their coat colors. But they also engineered these same mice to pass on the genes that create CRISPR itself so that progeny edit their own genomes to carry the coat color–modifying gene. When they mated an engineered mouse to a normal one, it should have created a pup with the coat color–modifying gene in one of two chromosomes. But because the pup also inherited CRISPR, it altered the unmodified chromosome passed down from the normal parent so that it, too, had the gene. The experiment, in bioRxiv—a preprint server that is not peer reviewed—only worked when the researcher controlled the timing of the CRISPR reaction so that it happened during meiosis—and it didn't work in males. The researchers stressed that the use of gene drives in mammals to control pests is still a long way from becoming a reality. 2017 © The Authors, some rights reserved",,"guide RNA; chromosome; experimental study; gene expression; genetic engineering; laboratory method; mammal; rodent; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; CRISPR-CAS9 system; gene drive technology; gene editing; genetic engineering; genome analysis; nonhuman; priority journal; progeny; Short Survey; animal; CRISPR Cas system; genetics; inbred mouse strain; mouse; procedures; California; San Diego; United States; Hexapoda; Mammalia; Mus; Animals; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Gene Drive Technology; Gene Editing; Mice; Mice, Inbred Strains",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,"30002234","English","Sci.",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050446368

Those tests account for nearly 60% of the estimated 3 million to 4 million animals used annually in risk testing worldwide. The computerized tool—built on a massive database of molecular structures and existing safety data—appears to match, and sometimes improve on, the results of animal tests for properties such as skin sensitization and eye irritation, the researchers report in today's issue of Toxicological Sciences. But it also has limitations; for instance, the method can't reliably evaluate a chemical's risk of causing cancer. And it's not clear how open regulatory agencies will be to adopting a nonanimal approach, although both European and U.S. regulators say they are open to the idea. Still, the big data approach is encouraging to those seeking to reduce and replace animal testing. 2017 © The Authors, some rights reserved",,"chemical compound; cancer; computer simulation; database; eye; skin; testing method; toxicology; animal testing reduction; animal testing replacement; cancer risk; chemical structure; data base; eye irritation; nonhuman; priority journal; reproducibility; Short Survey; skin sensitization; United States; animal; animal testing alternative; chemical database; computer; procedures; statistics and numerical data; toxicity testing; Animalia; Animal Use Alternatives; Animals; Computers; Databases, Chemical; Toxicity Tests",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Zainzinger, V.United Kingdom",,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,"30002233","English","Sci.",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050443774

Once the egg and the sperm have fused, the parental chromosomes need to be united. To this end, the egg and sperm chromosomes are first packaged into two separate membrane-enclosed nuclei. These nuclei then slowly move toward each other and break down in the center of the fertilized egg, called the zygote. Only then are the maternal and paternal chromosomes united—but not quite. Surprisingly, the parental chromosomes do not mix immediately but instead occupy distinct territories in the zygote throughout the first cellular division (2, 3). How the autonomy of parental genomes is retained after fertilization has remained unclear. On page 189 of this issue, Reichmann et al. (4) used elegant microscopy methods to illuminate this special moment, when the parental chromosomes first meet in live mouse zygotes, and follow how the chromosomes become distributed as the zygote divides. Their findings reveal an unexpected mechanism that keeps the parental genomes apart during the first division of the embryo: The male and female chromosomes each assemble their own chromosome separation machineries. This increases the probability that chromosomes are separated into multiple, unequal groups, which may compromise embryo development and give rise to spontaneous miscarriage. 2017 © The Authors, some rights reserved",,"chromosome; egg; histology; machinery; membrane; origin of life; sperm; detection method; embryonic development; genome; gymnosperm; cell division; cell nucleus; centrosome; chromosome segregation; DNA sequence; embryo development; fertilization; human; human chromosome; in vitro fertilization; mammalian embryo; multipara; nonhuman; parental chromosome; priority journal; risk assessment; Short Survey; spindle apparatus; zygote; beginning of human life; life; Beginning of Human Life; Life",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Möglich, A., Yang, X., Ayers, R.A., Moffat, K., (2010) Annu.

Rapidly growing demand for these services, combined with long lead times for technology development and long lifetimes of energy infrastructure, make decarbonization of these services both essential and urgent.We examine barriers and opportunities associated with these difficult-to-decarbonize services and processes, including possible technological solutions and research and development priorities. A range of existing technologies could meet future demands for these services and processes without net addition of CO2 to the atmosphere, but their use may depend on a combination of cost reductions via research and innovation, as well as coordinated deployment and integration of operations across currently discrete energy industries. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In one email cited by investigators, an NIAAA staffer counseled another not to respond to a colleague’s question about the activities, while allowing, “We can’t keep him totally in the dark.” Another email, apparently intended for an industry source, was composed by an NIAAA staffer and run past the PI, who approved it. The message read, in part: “One of the important findings will be showing that moderate drinking is safe.” Ultimately, five companies donated funds to the MACH trial: Anheuser-Busch InBev, based in Leuven, Belgium; Carlsberg Breweries of Copenhagen; Diageo, based in London; Heineken, in Amsterdam; and Pernod Ricard USA, based in New York City.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,"29930119","English","Sci.",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048946649

It has now expanded to more than 115 churches, some of which also test for malaria, syphilis, and anemia. Led by Echezona Ezeanolue, a pediatrician who works with the Healthy-Sunrise Foundation based in Las Vegas, Nevada, the intervention takes advantage of the fact that some 90% of Nigerians regularly attend either church or mosque services. “That was a perfect place to test this,” says Ezeanolue, a Nigerian who left the country 20 years ago. (Ezeanolue resigned from the University of Nevada in Las Vegas in March after a prolonged dispute with the school about what it alleged were financial irregularities with the maternal HIV program he ran there. He insists he did nothing wrong.) Sani Aliyu adds that Baby Shower has another advantage. “The religious leaders don’t carry the burden of politicians,” he says. “People believe in what they say, and people follow them.” In a study of the project in 40 churches, half of which received the intervention, Baby Shower increased HIV testing in pregnant women from 55% in the control churches to 92%, the researchers reported in the November 2015 issue of The Lancet Global Health. A study published in AIDS and Behavior last year shows that in women’s male partners, testing jumped from 38% to 84%. “With Baby Shower, you don’t have to go to the hospital for an HIV test—you go to the church and nobody suspects anything,” says Amaka Ogidi, coordinator of the project here. A follow-up study is assessing the actual impact on HIV transmission rates to the babies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,"29903952","English","Sci.",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054469432

The interchange of nitrogen oxidation states in the industrial production of ammonia, nitric acid, and other commodity chemicals is largely powered by fossil fuels. A key goal of contemporary research in the field of nitrogen chemistry is to minimize the use of fossil fuels by developing more efficient heterogeneous, homogeneous, photo-, and electrocatalytic processes or by adapting the enzymatic processes underlying the natural nitrogen cycle.

These nanofibers exhibit exciton transfer from the core to the lower-energy polythiophene coronas in the end blocks, which occurs in the direction of the interchain p-p stacking with very long diffusion lengths (>200 nanometers) and a large diffusion coefficient (0.5 square centimeters per second). This is made possible by the uniform exciton energetic landscape created by the well-ordered, crystalline nanofiber core. 2017 © The Authors.",,"fluorene; nanofiber; poly(di n hexylfluorene); polymer; polythiophene; thiophene; unclassified drug; instrumentation; long range transport; nanoparticle; nanotechnology; polymer; atomic force microscopy; crystallization; diffusion coefficient; energy; energy transfer; landscape; photoluminescence; photon correlation spectroscopy; priority journal; Review; steady state; time correlated single photon counting; transmission electron microscopy; X ray crystallography",,"fluorene, 86-73-7; thiophene, 110-02-1",,,"Advanced Foods and Materials Canada, AFM; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, EPSRC: EP/K016520/1, EP/K017799/1, EP/K03927X/1, EP/L022532/1, EP/M005143/1; King Abdullah University of Science and Technology, KAUST","We thank A.

The Giant Magellan Tele-scope (GMT), a 25-meter telescope under construction in Chile, and the Thirty Meter Telescope (TMT), which backers hope to build atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii, are still short of partners and money. They will now work together to win funding from the National Science Foundation (NSF) in Alexandria, Virginia, which could help the projects catch up to a third giant telescope, the 39-meter European Extremely Large Telescope (ELT), due to begin operations in 2024. It is a historic peace accord to end a conflict that has divided funders and delayed both projects. “This division has set back U.S. astronomy a decade,” says Richard Ellis, an astronomer at University College London, and a former leader of the TMT effort. “Let’s turn the corner.” Patrick McCarthy, a GMT vice president in Pasadena, California, adds, “It’s time for these two projects to come together behind a single vision.” The partnership, approved by the GMT board this month and by the TMT board last month, commits the two projects to developing a joint plan that would allow astronomers from any institution to use the",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,"29798860","English","Sci.",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047379022

We mostly continue to use pesticides as if resistance is a temporary issue that will be addressed by commercialization of new pesticides with novel modes of action. However, current evidence suggests that insect and weed evolution may outstrip our ability to replace outmoded chemicals and other control mechanisms. To avoid this outcome, we must address the mix of ecological, genetic, economic, and sociopolitical factors that prevent implementation of sustainable pest management practices.

Some antimicrobial resistant pathogens have outpaced us, with untreatable infections appearing in hospitals and the community. However, WGS has additionally provided us with enough knowledge to initiate countermeasures. Although we cannot stop bacterial adaptation, the predictability of many evolutionary processes in AMR bacteria offers us an opportunity to channel them using new control strategies. Furthermore, by using WGS for coordinating surveillance and to create a more fundamental understanding of the outcome of antimicrobial treatment and AMR mechanisms, we can use current and future antimicrobials more effectively and aim to extend their longevity. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The azoles, for example, are used not only for human and animal health care and crop protection but also in antifouling coatings and timber preservation. The ubiquity and multiple uses of azoles have hastened the independent evolution of resistance in many environments. One consequence is an increasing risk in human health care from naturally occurring opportunistic fungal pathogens that have acquired resistance to this broad class of chemicals.

The mathematical expressions given in the Report were correct, but the code used to calculate the numerical values included an extraneous factor, which led to incorrect results. The magnetic fields calculated from the observations at different wavelengths were all scaled by the same factor, so after this is removed they remain consistent with each other. The corrected value of the magnetic field is lower than previously calculated, making the field in V404 Cygni even more unlike those estimated for other systems. However, the lower magnetic field is no longer consistent with the value predicted from the equipartition model. The text, materials and methods, Table S1, and Figure S3 have been updated to reflect the corrected magnetic field values and to state that the system was not in equipartition. No other results or conclusions of the study were affected. The authors thank J. Malzac (Institut de Recherche en Astrophysique et Planétologie, Université de Toulouse) for alerting them to this error. © Request Permissions",,"erratum",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,,"English","Sci.",Erratum,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086032016

Somatic mutations can generate cancer-specific neoepitopes that are recognized by autologous Tcells as foreign and constitute ideal cancer vaccine targets. Every tumor has its own unique composition of mutations, with only a small fraction shared between patients. Technological advances in genomics, data science, and cancer immunotherapy now enable the rapid mapping of the mutations within a genome, rational selection of vaccine targets, and on-demand production of a therapy customized to a patient's individual tumor. First-in-human clinical trials of personalized cancer vaccines have shown the feasibility, safety, and immunotherapeutic activity of targeting individual tumor mutation signatures. With vaccination development being promoted byemerging innovations of the digital age, vaccinating a patient with individual tumor mutations may become the first truly personalized treatment for cancer. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

This ""metagenome"" regulates cancer initiation, progression, and response to therapies. Besides the capacity of distinct microbial species to modulate the pharmacodynamics of chemotherapeutic drugs, symbiosis between epithelial barriers and their microbial ecosystems has a major impact on the local and distant immune system, markedly influencing clinical outcome in cancer patients. Efficacy of cancer immunotherapy with immune checkpoint antibodies can be diminished with administration of antibiotics, and superior efficacy is observed with the presence of specific gut microbes. Future strategies of precision medicine will likely rely on novel diagnostic and therapeutic tools with which to identify and correct defects in the microbiome that compromise therapeutic efficacy. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

This can be achieved by antibodies blocking the cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) or the programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) pathway, either alone or in combination. The main premise for inducing an immune response is the preexistence of antitumor T cells that were limited by specific immune checkpoints. Most patients who have tumor responses maintain long-lasting disease control, yet one-third of patients relapse. Mechanisms of acquired resistance are currently poorly understood, but evidence points to alterations that converge on the antigen presentation and interferon-g signaling pathways. New-generation combinatorial therapies may overcome resistance mechanisms to immune checkpoint therapy. © 2018 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

For example, most posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, methylation, and acetylation promote proximity of molecules to play deterministic roles in cellular processes.To understand the role of proximity in biologic mechanisms, chemical inducers of proximity (CIPs) were developed to synthetically model biologically regulated recruitment. Chemically induced proximity allows for precise temporal control of transcription, signaling cascades, chromatin regulation, protein folding, localization, and degradation, as well as a host of other biologic processes. A systematic analysis of CIPs in basic research, coupled with recent technological advances utilizing CRISPR, distinguishes roles of causality from coincidence and allows for mathematical modeling in synthetic biology. Recently, induced proximity has provided new avenues of gene therapy and emerging advances in cancer treatment. © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"adenosine triphosphate; caspase 9; cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein; protein kinase ZAP 70; ubiquitin protein ligase; FK 1012; ligand; protein; tacrolimus; acetylene; cancer; gene; induced response; medicine; methylation; molecular analysis; protein; biochemistry; biotechnology; cell function; cell therapy; chemically induced proximity; clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; dimerization; enzyme inactivation; gene control; gene therapy; human; molecular interaction; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein degradation; protein folding; protein localization; protein transport; regulatory mechanism; Review; signal transduction; transcription regulation; analogs and derivatives; animal; biological mimicry; biological therapy; chemistry; chromatin; CRISPR Cas system; genetic transcription; protein processing; trends; Animals; Biological Mimicry; Cell- and Tissue-Based Therapy; Chromatin; CRISPR-Cas Systems; Genetic Therapy; Humans; Ligands; Protein Folding; Protein Processing, Post-Translational; Proteins; Proteolysis; Signal Transduction; Tacrolimus; Transcription, Genetic",,"adenosine triphosphate, 15237-44-2, 56-65-5, 987-65-5; caspase 9, 180189-96-2; cellular apoptosis susceptibility protein, 237743-38-3; protein kinase ZAP 70, 148047-34-1; ubiquitin protein ligase, 134549-57-8; protein, 67254-75-5; tacrolimus, 104987-11-3; Chromatin; FK 1012; Ligands; Proteins; Tacrolimus",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: F31 CA203228-02; National Institutes of Health, NIH; Howard Hughes Medical Institute, HHMI: NIH 5R01CA163915-04; National Cancer Institute, NCI: R01CA163915; National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, NINDS: R37NS046789; Simons Foundation; Norsk Sykepleierforbund, NSF","We apologize to the many people who have made important contributions to this field whom we were unable to acknowledge because of space constraints.

Such beliefs threatened the “sound American diet, where nutritional adequacy is built around meat, milk and eggs.” But within a few years, the Harvard team became deeply engaged in research contributing to a new causal paradigm in which heart attacks were the end result of a long-term accumulation of fatty material in the coronary arteries, suggesting possibilities for prevention. Many heart disease sufferers had high serum cholesterol levels, and various investigators had produced arterial disease in animals by feeding foods such as eggs. Wartime data appeared to show European populations deprived of fatty animal foods experienced a decline in coronary deaths. Influential early studies of this emerging dietary fat hypothesis were supported by the U.S. dairy industry.","During the period in question, food in dustry funding of nutrition research was routine, and disclosures were “rarely required,” as Marion Nestle has written. When NIH moved to defund Framingham in 1968, its former director rescued it by soliciting grants from the Oscar Mayer Foundation and other private entities—none of which were routinely disclosed in publications. Today, food industry funding of research remains common, although most journals require disclosure of conflicts of interest. Compliance is inconsistent, however, and some argue existing policies do not address important sources of bias such as investigators’ dietary habits and beliefs.","By 1951, Stare had secured 27 funders, including the U.S. Public Health Service, the Nutrition Foundation, the American Meat Institute, the National Dairy Council, the American Cancer Society, the Eli Lilly Company, and the Sugar Research Foundation (SRF). According to Bernard Lown, a cardiologist hired by Stare in 1958, it was “natural” and “proper” for Stare to turn to the food industry in accord with the mores of the time. “There was no sense of ‘being bought,’” recalled Lown, who later accepted, along with a Soviet colleague, the 1985 Nobel Peace Prize awarded to International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War. Nor were there demands from journals that authors provide financial disclosures, Lown said. “It wasn’t required. It never entered my mind!” (7).",,,,,,,,"Glantz, S.A., Bero, L.A., Slade, J., Hanauer, P., Barnes, D.E., (1998) The Cigarette Papers, , University of California Press; Lustig, R.H., (2013) Pure, White, and Deadly: How Sugar Is Killing Us, and What We Can Do to Stop It, p. 12. , J.

The utility of C–H activation in organic synthesis, however, cannot be fully realized until chemists achieve stereocontrol in the modification of C–H bonds. This Review highlights recent efforts to enantioselectively functionalize C(sp 3 )–H bonds via transition metal catalysis, with an emphasis on key principles for both the development of chiral ligand scaffolds that can accelerate metalation of C(sp 3 )–H bonds and stereomodels for asymmetric metalation of prochiral C–H bonds by these catalysts. 2017 © The Authors.",,"carbon; hydrogen; metal; carbon; catalysis; catalyst; chemical bonding; hydrogen; ligand; transition element; asymmetric synthesis; catalyst; chemical bond; chemical modification; chemical reaction kinetics; chemical structure; chirality; enantiomer; enantioselectivity; ligand binding; priority journal; Review",,"carbon, 7440-44-0; hydrogen, 12385-13-6, 1333-74-0",,,"CHE-1205646; National Science Foundation; National Institutes of Health; National Institute of General Medical Sciences: R01GM084019; Boehringer Ingelheim; Bristol-Myers Squibb; Scripps Research Institute","The authors thank The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI), NIH (National Institute of General Medical Sciences, grant 2R01GM084019) and Bristol-Myers Squibb, as well as NSF under the Centers for Chemical Innovation Center for Selective C–H Functionalization (CHE-1205646) for financial support.

This definition thus excludes most biological processes, Friedel-Crafts reactions, metal-oxo/H-atom abstraction processes, metallonitrene reactions, and metallocarbene reactions, which instead represent distinct facets of the broader category of “C–H functionalization” processes.

The result would have been a bloodbath for science agencies, White House documents show, proposing a 21% cut to overall federal spending on basic research, a 27% cut at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), a 30% cut to the National Science Foundation (NSF), and a 22% cut to the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Office of Science.",,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,"29449467","English","Sci.",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042179730

Earth system models, which simulate terrestrial and marine ecosystems and biogeochemical cycles, offer a common framework for ecological research related to climate processes; analyses of vulnerability, impacts, and adaptation; and climate change mitigation. They provide an opportunity to move beyond physical descriptors of atmospheric and oceanic states to societally relevant quantities such as wildfire risk, habitat loss, water availability, and crop, fishery, and timber yields. To achieve this, the science of climate prediction must be extended to a more multifaceted Earth system prediction that includes the biosphere and its resources.",,"biogeochemical cycle; climate change; climate prediction; ecosystem service; future prospect; global change; marine ecosystem; mitigation; nature-society relations; research work; terrestrial ecosystem; biodiversity; biogeochemical cycle; biosphere; climate; climate change; ecosystem; environmental impact; evolutionary adaptation; fishery; geology; global change; habitat; harvest; human; land biome; marine environment; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; water availability; wildfire; astronomy; biological model; climate change; life; sea; Climate Change; Earth (Planet); Ecosystem; Life; Models, Biological; Oceans and Seas",,,,,"National Science Foundation, NSF; National Aeronautics and Space Administration, NASA: NNX14AL86G; U.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA: 2015-67003-23485; National Institute of Food and Agriculture, NIFA","We acknowledge funding from the National Institute of Food and Agriculture/U.S. Department of Agriculture (2015-67003-23485) and the NASA Ocean Biology and Biogeochemistry Program (NNX14AL86G).

Such interventions include caloric restriction mimetics, which are defined as agents that mimic the beneficial effects of dietary restriction while limiting its detrimental effects. One such agent, the natural polyamine spermidine, has prominent cardioprotective and neuroprotective effects and stimulates anticancer immunosurveillance in rodent models. Moreover, dietary polyamine uptake correlates with reduced cardiovascular and cancer-related mortality in human epidemiological studies. Spermidine preserves mitochondrial function, exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, and prevents stem cell senescence. Mechanistically, it shares the molecular pathways engaged by other caloric restriction mimetics: It induces protein deacetylation and depends on functional autophagy. Because spermidine is already present in daily human nutrition, clinical trials aiming at increasing the uptake of this polyamine appear feasible. © 2017 The Authors.",,"arginine; nitric oxide; spermidine; neuroprotective agent; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; spermidine; cancer; cardiovascular disease; disease; epidemiology; immune response; molecular analysis; mortality; organic compound; aging; Alzheimer disease; antiinflammatory activity; antineoplastic activity; antioxidant activity; autophagy; biomimetics; caloric restriction; cancer inhibition; cancer mortality; carcinogenesis; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cell aging; cell function; deacetylation; diet; diseases; health; heart protection; human; immunomodulation; immunosurveillance; life extension; malignant neoplasm; metabolism; neuroprotection; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; nonhuman; nutrition; obesity; priority journal; Review; animal; caloric restriction; cardiovascular disease; dietary supplement; drug effects; metabolic syndrome X; physiology; transport at the cellular level; Rodentia; Aging; Animals; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Autophagy; Biological Transport; Caloric Restriction; Carcinogenesis; Cardiovascular Diseases; Dietary Supplements; Humans; Metabolic Syndrome; Neuroprotective Agents; Spermidine",,"arginine, 1119-34-2, 15595-35-4, 7004-12-8, 74-79-3; nitric oxide, 10102-43-9; spermidine, 124-20-9, 334-50-9; Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; Neuroprotective Agents; Spermidine",,,"F3012, I1000, P23490-B20, P24381, P29203 P27893, P29262; W1226; Association pour la Recherche sur le Cancer, ARC; European Commission, EC; European Research Council, ERC; Agence Nationale de la Recherche, ANR; Fondation Leducq; Institut National de la Santé et de la Recherche Médicale: WO2015049365 A3; Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale, FRM; Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft, BMWFW; Ligue Contre le Cancer; Institut Universitaire de France, IUF; Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft, FFG: 855987; Université Pierre et Marie Curie; Institut National Du Cancer, INCa; Labex Immuno-Oncology","F.M., T.E., and G.K. are inventors on a patent application (WO2010081204 A3) submitted by Katholieke Universiteit Leuven that covers the use of spermidine for life-span extension.

These effects will likely disincen-tivize joint research on both sides.” Cuban cancer researchers Tays Hernández and Janoi Chang have also been blocked in their attempt to par-ticipate in the AAAS Cuban Biomedical Fel-lows program. The two were to have arrived in Boston by early this year to work with researchers at Boston Children’s Hospital, using molecules made in Cuba that show promise in the development of new drugs and imaging tools for cancer therapy and autoimmune or inflammatory diseases. They have been unable, however, to even begin the visa application process. “We couldn’t travel to the United States, despite the financial support we had from AAAS,” Hernández and Chang wrote in an email, referring to funding provided by the Lounsbery Foundation to the AAAS program. “For the moment, the project is blocked.”",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,,"English","Sci.",Short Survey,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040966843

Single-molecule Förster resonance energy transfer (smFRET) paved the way for studying dynamics in macromolecular structures under biologically relevant conditions. Since its first implementation in 1996, smFRET experiments have confirmed previously hypothesized mechanisms and provided new insights into many fundamental biological processes, such as DNA maintenance and repair, transcription, translation, and membrane transport. We review 22 years of contributions of smFRET to our understanding of basic mechanisms in biochemistry, molecular biology, and structural biology. Additionally, building on current state-of-the-art implementations of smFRET, we highlight possible future directions for smFRET in applications such as biosensing, high-throughput screening, and molecular diagnostics.",,"adenylate kinase; DNA topoisomerase; helicase; membrane protein; nucleic acid; ribozyme; RNA polymerase; biochemistry; biology; detection method; DNA; energy flux; molecular analysis; resonance; catalysis; conformational transition; DNA repair; DNA replication; DNA transcription; enzyme activity; enzyme conformation; enzyme mechanism; fluorometry; membrane transport; priority journal; protein folding; protein function; Review; RNA folding; RNA translation; single molecular Forster resonance energy transfer; standardization; conformation; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; history; molecular biology; procedures; protein conformation; single molecule imaging; trends; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Molecular Biology; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Protein Conformation; Single Molecule Imaging",,"adenylate kinase, 9013-02-9; DNA topoisomerase, 80449-01-0; helicase, 42613-29-6; RNA polymerase, 9014-24-8",,,"National Science Foundation, NSF: GM095904, MCB-1244175; National Institutes of Health, NIH; National Institute of General Medical Sciences, NIGMS: R01GM069709, R01GM095904; European Research Council, ERC: ERC-STG 638536–SM-IMPORT; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: GRK2062; Norsk Sykepleierforbund, NSF","We acknowledge contributions and discussions with past and present members of the Weiss lab.

Scientists and clinicians engaged in basic, translational, and clinical research, supported by government and philanthropies, will continue to innovate and provide new or improved technologies. The increasing involvement of the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors in gene therapy efforts demonstrates the maturation of the field and is necessary to accelerate delivery of these treatments to patients. Many challenges remain, including addressing genotoxicity from integrating gene delivery vectors or off-target genome editing, improving gene transfer or editing efficiency to levels necessary for effective treatment of many diseases, addressing immune responses to repeated in vivo administration of vectors, and reaching a societal consensus regarding contentious issues such as the ethics of germline editing and payment for expensive curative therapies. The potential for gene therapy to provide durable benefits to human health, exemplified by the scientific advances and clinical successes over the past several years, justifies continued optimism and increasing efforts toward making this therapy part of our standard armamentarium for treatment of serious human diseases.","The rapid technological advances in genome editing have made heritable germline editing [defined as manipulation of germ cells, gametes, zygotes, or embryos with the intent to generate a new human being with the ability to pass on the edited gene(s) to future generations] a realistic possibility. In 2015, scientists in China published results from experiments using CRISPR-Cas9 to attempt to modify the hemoglobin gene in “nonviable” preimplantation human embryos, demonstrating low efficiency and reportedly frequent off-target mutations (80). This publication prompted statements of concern from professional societies around the world (81) and a series of meetings sponsored by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine that brought together an international group of scientists, clinicians, ethicists, patient advocates, and government officials. This group published a report in 2017 laying out principles of governance and oversight for human genome editing, and presenting a possible pathway for eventual use of genome editing technologies to correct germline mutations for certain serious diseases (82). In the United States, federal government funds presently cannot be used for research on germline editing and clinical trials cannot be considered for approval by the FDA. Similar restrictions exist in many other countries. Clearly most countries are far from a societal consensus on germline editing. The acquisition of more efficacy and safety data from studies of genome editing in somatic cells is critical before implementation of human germline editing can be considered.",,,,,,,,,"Friedmann, T., Roblin, R., Gene therapy for human genetic disease?

Not only is it essential for the survival of individual animals, but it regulates global cycles of major nutrients and carbon. The oxygen content of the open ocean and coastal waters has been declining for at least the past half-century, largely because of human activities that have increased global temperatures and nutrients discharged to coastal waters. These changes have accelerated consumption of oxygen by microbial respiration, reduced solubility of oxygen in water, and reduced the rate of oxygen resupply from the atmosphere to the ocean interior, with a wide range of biological and ecological consequences. Further research is needed to understand and predict long-term, global-and regional-scale oxygen changes and their effects on marine and estuarine fisheries and ecosystems.",,"iron; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; oxygen; phosphorus; oxygen; sea water; air-sea interaction; coastal water; dissolved oxygen; ecological impact; estuarine ecosystem; gas exchange; global ocean; global warming; human activity; marine ecosystem; open ocean; oxygen; oxygen consumption; solubility; acidification; atmosphere; biodiversity; biogeochemical cycle; biogeochemistry; climate change; coastal waters; denitrification; deoxygenation; ecosystem; environmental enrichment; environmental exposure; eutrophication; greenhouse effect; human; microbial respiration; mineralization; nitrification; nonhuman; nutrient; oxygen concentration; oxygen consumption; oxygen supply; prediction; priority journal; Review; sea; solubility; space; stratification; temperature; time; warming; adaptation; animal; aquatic species; chemistry; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; fishery; greenhouse effect; sea; Animalia; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Aquatic Organisms; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Fisheries; Global Warming; Oceans and Seas; Oxygen; Seawater",,"iron, 14093-02-8, 53858-86-9, 7439-89-6; nitrogen, 7727-37-9; nitrous oxide, 10024-97-2; oxygen, 7782-44-7; phosphorus, 7723-14-0; Oxygen",,,"2112932-1; 1324095; National Science Foundation, NSF: 1433759, 1459243; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA: NA10NOS4780138; Institut national de la recherche scientifique, INRS: T.1009.15; European Commission, EC; Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG: SFB754; Svenska Forskningsrådet Formas","We thank IOC-UNESCO for financial support and for initiating and supporting the Global Ocean Oxygen Network.

We report a draft of the opium poppy genome, with 2.72 Gb assembled into 11 chromosomes with contig N50 and scaffold N50 of 1.77 Mb and 204 Mb, respectively. Synteny analysis suggests a whole genome duplication at approximately 7.8 million years ago (MYA) and ancient segmental or whole genome duplication(s) that occurred before the Papaveraceae-Ranunculaceae divergence 110 MYA. Syntenic blocks representative of phthalideisoquinoline and morphinan components of a benzylisoquinoline alkaloid cluster of 15 genes provides insight into how it evolved. Paralog analysis identified P450 and oxidoreductase genes that combined to form the STORR gene fusion essential for morphinan biosynthesis in opium poppy. Thus gene duplication, rearrangement and fusion events have led to evolution of specialized metabolic products in opium poppy. © The Authors, some rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jacomet, S., Plant economy and village life in Neolithic lake dwellings at the time of the Alpine Iceman (2009) Veg.

However, the widely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 enzyme (SpCas9) requires an NGG protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) for target recognition, thereby restricting the targetable genomic loci. Here, we report a rationally engineered SpCas9 variant (SpCas9-NG) that can recognize relaxed NG PAMs. The crystal structure revealed that the loss of the base-specific interaction with the third G is compensated by newly introduced non-base-specific interactions, enabling the NG PAM recognition. We showed that SpCas9-NG induces indels at endogenous target sites bearing NG PAMs in human cells. Furthermore, we found that the fusion of SpCas9-NG and the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) mediates the C-to-T conversion at target sites with NG PAMs in human cells. © The Authors, some rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Jinek, M., Chylinski, K., Fonfara, I., Hauer, M., Doudna, J.A., Charpentier, E., A programmable dual-RNA-guided DNA endonuclease in adaptive bacterial immunity (2012) Science, 337, pp. 816-821; Cong, L., Ran, F.A., Cox, D., Lin, S., Barretto, R., Habib, N., Hsu, P.D., Zhang, F., Multiplex genome engineering using CRISPR/Cas systems (2013) Science, 339, pp. 819-823; Sternberg, S.H., Redding, S., Jinek, M., Greene, E.C., Doudna, J.A., DNA interrogation by the CRISPR RNA-guided endonuclease Cas9 (2014) Nature, 507, pp. 62-67; Kleinstiver, B.P., Prew, M.S., Tsai, S.Q., Topkar, V.V., Nguyen, N.T., Zheng, Z., Gonzales, A.P.W., Joung, J.K., Engineered CRISPR-Cas9 nucleases with altered PAM specificities (2015) Nature, 523, pp. 481-485; Ran, F.A., Cong, L., Yan, W.X., Scott, D.A., Gootenberg, J.S., Kriz, A.J., Zetsche, B., Zhang, F., (2015) Vivo Genome Editing Using Staphylococcus Aureus Cas9.

To balance symbiosis and plant growth, legume hosts restrict nodule numbers through an inducible autoregulatory process. Here, we present a mechanism where repression of a negative regulator ensures symbiotic susceptibility of uninfected roots of the host Lotus japonicus. We show that microRNA miR2111 undergoes shoot-to-root translocation to control rhizobial infection through posttranscriptional regulation of the symbiosis suppressor TOO MUCH LOVE in roots. miR2111 maintains a susceptible default status in uninfected hosts and functions as an activator of symbiosis downstream of LOTUS HISTIDINE KINASE1–mediated cytokinin perception in roots and HYPERNODULATION ABERRANT ROOT FORMATION1, a shoot factor in autoregulation.

This Landau quantization is generally absent in insulators. Here we report a notable exception in an insulator — ytterbium dodecaboride (YbBi2>. The resistivity of YbBi2, which is of a much larger magnitude than the resistivity in metals, exhibits distinct quantum oscillations. These unconventional oscillations arise from the insulating bulk, even though the temperature dependence of the oscillation amplitude follows the conventional Fermi liquid theory of metals with a large effective mass. Quantum oscillations in the magnetic torque are also observed, albeit with a lighter effective mass. © The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"article; oscillation; temperature dependence; torque",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Tsunetsugu, H., Sigrist, M., Ueda, K., The ground-state phase diagram of the one-dimensional Kondo lattice model (1997) Rev.

With the resulting data, we compare the pseudotemporal dynamics of chromatin accessibility and gene expression, reconstruct the chromatin accessibility profiles of cell types defined by RNA profiles, and link cis-regulatory sites to their target genes on the basis of the covariance of chromatin accessibility and transcription across large numbers of single cells. © The Authors, some rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Clark, S.J., Argelaguet, R., Kapourani, C.-A., Stubbs, T.M., Lee, H.J., Alda-Catalinas, C., Krueger, F., Reik, W., SeNMT-seq enables joint profiling of chromatin accessibility DNA methylation and transcription in single cells (2018) Nat.

Without it, the relative importance of acquired memories in a changing environment is lost. We discovered that Synaptotagmin-3 (Syt3) localizes to post-synaptic endocytic zones and removes AMPA receptors from synaptic plasma membranes in response to stimulation. AMPA receptor internalization, long-term-depression (LTD), and decay of long-term-potentiation (LTP) of synaptic strength required calcium-sensing by Syt3, and were abolished by Syt3 knockout. In spatial memory tasks Syt3 knockout mice learned normally, but exhibited a lack of forgetting. Disrupting Syt3:GluA2 binding in a wild-type background mimicked the lack of LTP decay and lack of forgetting, and these effects were occluded in the Syt3 knockout background. Our findings provide evidence for a molecular mechanism whereby Syt3 internalizes AMPA receptors to depress synaptic strength and promote forgetting. © 2018 by The University of Chicago.

The combination of agricultural processes in which production is maintained or increased, while environmental outcomes are enhanced, is currently known as sustainable intensification (SI). SI aims to avoid the cultivation of more land, and thus avoid the loss of unfarmed habitats, but also aims to increase overall system performance without net environmental cost. For example, large changes are now beginning to occur to maximize biodiversity by means of integrated pest management, pasture and forage management, the incorporation of trees into agriculture, and irrigation management, and with small and patch systems.

Mobile elements, in turn, encode various anti-CRISPR (Acr) proteins to inhibit the immune function of CRISPR-Cas. To date, Acr proteins have been discovered for type I (subtypes l-D, l-E, and l-F) and type II (ll-A and ll-C) but not other CRISPR systems. Here we report the discovery of 12 acr genes, including inhibitors of type V-A and l-C CRISPR systems. Notably, AcrVAl inhibits a broad spectrum of Casl2a (Cpfl) orthologs including MbCasl2a, Mb3Casl2a, AsCasl2a, and LbCasl2a when assayed in human cells. The acr genes reported here provide useful biotechnological tools and mark the discovery of acr loci in many bacteria and phages. © 2018, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Regulatory T cells (Tregs) suppress immune cells within close proximity by activating latent TGF-β1 presented by GARP to integrin αVβ8 on their surface. We solved the crystal structure of GARP:latent TGF-β1 bound to an antibody that stabilizes the complex and blocks release of active TGF-β1. This reveals how GARP exploits an unusual medley of interactions, including fold complementation by the N terminus of TGF-β1, to chaperone and orient the cytokine for binding and activation by αVβ8. Thus, this work further elucidates the mechanism of antibody-mediated blockade of TGF-β1 activation and immunosuppression by Tregs. © 2018, (publisher name).

Here, we show that human iPSC–derived cortical neurons transplanted in the adult mouse cortex consistently organized in large (up to ~100 mm3) vascularized neuron-glia territories with complex cytoarchitecture. Longitudinal imaging of &gt;4000 grafted developing human neurons revealed that neuronal arbors refined via branch-specific retraction; human synaptic networks substantially restructured over 4 months, with balanced rates of synapse formation and elimination; and oscillatory population activity mirrored the patterns of fetal neural networks. Finally, we found increased synaptic stability and reduced oscillations in transplants from two individuals with Down syndrome, demonstrating the potential of in vivo imaging in human tissue grafts for patient-specific modelling of cortical development, physiology, and pathogenesis. © 2018, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

To understand the role of these factors, we reconstructed the exhibition history of half a million artists, mapping out the coexhibition network that captures the movement of art between institutions. Centrality within this network captured institutional prestige, allowing us to explore the career trajectory of individual artists in terms of access to coveted institutions. Early access to prestigious central institutions offered life-long access to high-prestige venues and reduced dropout rate. By contrast, starting at the network periphery resulted in a high dropout rate, limiting access to central institutions. A Markov model predicts the career trajectory of individual artists and documents the strong path and history dependence of valuation in art. © 2018, American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The deltaE50-MD dog model of DMD harbors a mutation corresponding to a mutational “hot spot” in the human DMD gene. We used adeno-associated viruses to deliver CRISPR gene editing components to four dogs and examined dystrophin protein expression 6 weeks after intramuscular delivery (n=2) or 8 weeks after systemic delivery (n=2). After systemic delivery in skeletal muscle, dystrophin was restored to levels ranging from 3 to 90% of normal, depending on muscle type. In cardiac muscle, dystrophin levels in the dog receiving the highest dose reached 92% of normal. The treated dogs also showed improved muscle histology. These large animal data support the concept that, with further development, gene editing approaches may prove clinically useful for the treatment of DMD. © The Authors, some rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"O’Brien, K.F., Kunkel, L.M., Dystrophin and muscular dystrophy: Past, present, and future.
