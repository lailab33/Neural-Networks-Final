To gauge motions underwater, scientists rely on a daisy chain in which a ship tracks acoustic beacons on the sea floor—and the ship in turn fixes its position with GPS. Now, a team led by David Chadwell, a geophysicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, California, has found a way to cut costs by replacing the expensive ships with ocean-going drones. “It’s going to make a huge difference,” says Laura Wallace, a geodetic scientist at GNS Science in Lower Hutt, New Zealand. Last month, the U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) endorsed the approach by announcing a $5.5 million grant to Chadwell’s team to buy beacons for 16 seafloor sites and three drones to monitor them—more than doubling the ability of U.S. scientists",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,"31727808","English","Sci.",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075036510

Last week it also, serendipitously, issued a rare solicitation for prevention proposals in tickborne diseases. The new pot of money, $6 million in 2020, represents a significant boost; NIH spent $23 million last year on Lyme disease, by far the most common tickborne illness, within $56 million devoted to tick-borne diseases overall. “I’m happy for anything” new going to ward research, says John Aucott, director of the Johns Hopkins Lyme Disease Clinical Research Center in Baltimore, Maryland, who chaired the group that wrote the 2018 report. Strategies that may garner support include vaccines that target multiple pathogens carried by ticks or that kill the ticks themselves.","Nonvaccine prevention efforts are under way as well. Across 24 neighborhoods in Dutchess County in New York, Ostfeld and ecologist Felicia Keesing of Bard College in Annandale-on-Hudson, New York, are leading an effort to test whether a tick-killing fungus and a pesticide that kills ticks when applied to animals can reduce infection rates in people and pets. Much of that project is supported by the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Foundation, which has spent more than $42 million on Lyme and other tick-borne disease research since 2015. Two other groups, the Global Lyme Alliance and the Bay Area Lyme Foundation, have together directed more than $20 million to research in recent years. “These foundations are giving a lot of money,” says Embers, who receives foundation support. “They want translational research, and they want answers.” Foundations are keen to address the third rail of Lyme disease: how Borrelia bacteria persist—if they do—in treated patients who don’t get better. NIH’s strategic plan is due this summer, but Ostfeld says researchers coming together could make it easier for the agency to boost funding in a polarized field. “The responsibility,” he suggests, “lies at least in part with the community to try to avoid so much acrimony and to try to find areas of agreement.” j",,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,"31000643","English","Sci.",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065040196

Neela White, who helps manage the award at AAAS along with Michael Feder, said AAAS was truly “honored to be chosen to lead this award and to have the opportunity to interact with these scientists.” She noted that the award is part of the AAAS Center for Advancing Science and Engineering Capacity’s emphasis on highlighting and promoting diversity in science. White said that she hopes it will help “eliminate some of the stereotypes associated with traditionally male-dominated fields.” Holt noted that each of this year’s winners has made “extraordinary contributions” in basic research. Many of them, like Fullerton, made their groundbreaking discoveries by applying the lens of one discipline to solve problems that have stymied researchers in other disciplines. The recognition and funding from the Mason Award are especially critical because their research requires visibility in so many different fields. Awardees must make connections and collaborate with researchers in numerous fields, and funding for travel is limited. Adding to the challenge, fewer women than men are invited to speak at conferences, according to a 2018 study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Fullerton is a firm believer in the benefits of being an outsider—a theme that echoed through the other presentations at the awards ceremony. Another winner, Vivian Ferry, assistant professor of chemical engineering and materials science at the University of Minnesota, combines nanocrystal chemistry and nanoscale optics to study light-matter interactions in materials. In one of her projects, she integrates nanostructured mirrors into “solar-harvesting” windows that capture diffuse sunlight and improve the efficiency of solar cells and can blend into buildings.",,,,,,,,,,,"Lane, E.",,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,,"English","Sci.",Note,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060694677

The financial, empirical, and entomological con- sequences of the partial shutdown of the U.S. government for science multiplied this week, as it became the longest such closure in history. More than a half-dozen agencies that fund or conduct research, including NASA, the National Science Foundation (NSF), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have been partly paralyzed since 22 December 2018 (Science, 11 January, p. 109). As Science went to press, the fight between Congress and President Donald Trump over spending $5.7 billion on a border wall, which has shuttered about one-quarter of the federal government, showed no signs of being resolved.","from the pain because they are operated by contractors who get paid in advance, often on a quarterly basis. “But now that quarterly check may or may not be coming,” says Benjamin Corb, public affairs director at the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology in Rockville, Maryland. “The uncertainty is creating a real mess.” At the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, which is funded by NSF but operated by a consortium of universities, managers are beginning to consider ways to scale back activities. Staff could be given the option of being furloughed without pay or continuing to work at reduced pay (with back pay once the shutdown ends).

And one “immediate” result bigger payoff in the future. “Ten years is a of CPRIT’s $250 million in prevention grants short period of time for a scientific program.” has been cancer screening and other services California’s $3 billion stem cell agency was for 320,000 Texans a year, Willson says. CPRIT’s original inspiration, although Cali-Kolodner highlights CPRIT’s sup-fornia was responding to federal restrictions port for recruiting 181 researchers as “the on stem cell studies, whereas Texas wanted to gift that keeps on giving.” They include bolster the state’s research efforts and its bio-heavyweights such as MD Anderson’s Jim tech industry. After a smooth first few years, Allison, who won a Nobel Prize last year for a scandal broke out in 2012 over a $18 million his work on immunotherapies, and stem cell incubator award to MD Anderson that had researcher Sean Morrison of UT’s Southwest-not undergone scientific peer review. That, ern Medical Center in Dallas. But one large in-along with concerns that politics was skew-vestment had a shorter run than several CPRIT ing grant decisions, prompted CPRIT’s chief watchers say they expected. Mouse geneticists Neal Copeland and Nancy Jen-kins, recruited in 2011 from Sin-gapore to the Methodist Hospital Research Institute in Houston with a 5-year, $29 million joint package—half from CPRIT— retired after that money ran out. CPRIT, however, says the pair ful-filled their obligations, still serve as mentors and collaborate with labs, and were “a tremendous gain for cancer research in Texas.” In 2014, the agency capped its share of such awards to $6 million in order to recruit more scientists. CPRIT says its recruits have drawn additional grant money from other sources. Yet Texas’s National Cancer Institute fund-ing, which totaled $249 mil-$59.9 million Research training lion in 2018, has risen only 16% since 2008, below NCI’s overall budget growth of 23% over the same decade. Willson counters that since CPRIT’s incep-tion, NCI has tabbed two Texas sites as new Comprehensive Cancer Centers, which “cata-lyze something much greater than sum of the parts.” (MD Anderson was already a center.) Willson adds that many early-career CPRIT scholars are just now getting their first NCI grants, and he says funding from private re-search foundations has ballooned. CPRIT may still be an experiment, but Texas voters will almost certainly give it a chance to continue. That stands in contrast to California, where efforts to renew the California Institute for Regenerative Medi-cine face an uphill battle. Kolodner says, “I think sadly people probably relate to cancer much more than stem cells.” j",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,"31624193","English","Sci.",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073561569
