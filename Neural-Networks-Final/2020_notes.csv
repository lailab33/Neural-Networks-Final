For example, a burst of antibodies that cross-react with known coronaviruses would likely have been seen in Chinese cities, such as Wuhan, as SARS-CoV-2 began to spread there. The idea of regularly monitoring entire populations for antibodies arose in the lab of evolutionary biologist Bryan Grenfell at Princeton University, where Mina worked as a postdoctoral fellow. Now, Mina has joined Grenfell and Jessica Metcalf, also an evolutionary biologist at Princeton, in expanding the concept. Antibodies can signal not just people who are currently infected, but also those who had the disease and recovered. The GIO would also be able to distinguish dif-ferent strains of a bacterium or virus infecting people because each pro-duces a unique antibody signature. The GIO team is already building a pilot laboratory in Massachusetts, while it looks to secure financial support. “Given the importance we believe this could have, we are beginning to look for funding from some of the major philanthropic donors of public health work,” Mina says. “We are currently exploring and open to all options.” Meanwhile, the team’s pilot proj-ect, supported by the Open Phi-lanthropy foundation, is gathering many thousands of anonymous blood samples from the plasma-collecting company Octapharma. By screening them for antibodies to SARS-CoV-2, Mina and his colleagues hope to learn how useful widespread antibody testing can be in tracing the spread of the new coronavirus and possibly predicting future “hot spots” or localized outbreaks. People often do not develop antibodies until well after infections; for SARS-CoV-2 it takes 1 or 2 weeks. But Mina says the antibody testing still provides valuable information. “A week into an outbreak isn’t huge,” he said. “For example, if we were doing this with [blood from] just a small fraction of New York, we would have detected that [SARS-CoV-2] was there in February and could have given [Governor Andrew] Cuomo plenty of ammunition to close down the city March 1 instead of March 19.” j",,,,,,,,,,,"Bazell, R.; Yale UniversityUnited States",,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,"32587000","English","Sci.",Note,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087138113

Castillo Butters says that “in all fieldwork trips there has been no incident, no complaints.” On 2 June, Harvard Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean Claudine Gay put Urton on paid administrative leave pending a full review of the allegations. In a statement on 4 June, Gay said Harvard’s policy is to not comment on Title IX investigations. She added that “Harvard is deeply committed to providing an environment for all members of our community that is free from sexual harassment and misconduct. … We encourage any member of our community who has experienced inappropriate behavior to come forward.” Also on 2 June, the anthropology department removed Urton as director of undergraduate studies, a post he had held for 2 years after being department chair from 2012 to 2018. On 4 June, 25 faculty members in the department sent Urton a letter calling for him to resign. “The strong evidence put forth in these allegations has destroyed our confidence in your ability to be a teacher, colleague, and productive member of the department,” the letter said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,"32527811","English","Sci.",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086423953

City, there is now more than enough to go around, in part because thousands of members of the hard-hit Orthodox Jewish community have donated. Consistency is also an issue. The mix and concentration of antibodies differs from one donor to the next, which “is one of the un- fortunate reasons why the clinical evidence generated around convalescent plasma has remained rather shallow,” says Thomas Kreil, head of pathogen safety at Japa- nese pharma company Takeda. Together with several partners, Takeda is working to produce a product called hyperimmune globulin, for which the blood of hundreds of recovered patients is pooled and the anti- bodies concentrated about 10-fold. Hyper- immune globulin has a longer shelf life than plasma, and its higher concentration would allow doctors to give more antibodies to pa- tients without the risk of TACO. An efficacy trial, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, could start this summer. j",,,,,,,,,,,"Couzin-Frankel, J.",,,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",,,,,00368075,,SCIEA,"32467368","English","Sci.",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085635000

The National Science Foundation of China has postponed grant application deadlines by several weeks, giving researchers time to catch up. Online classes, which many universities and institutes have ramped up to keep students on schedule, are also keeping scientists busy. Poo Mu-ming, a neuroscientist at CAS’s Center for Excellence in Brain Science and Intelligence Technology, says he is teaching daily 2-hour neurobiology lectures: “Surprisingly, there are thousands of people tuning in each day.” China’s lockdown is felt even half a world away.
