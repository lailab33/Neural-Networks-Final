# Neural-Networks-Final
This is a repository for the code from my thesis Pilot Project.

To run the code yourself, download the entire folder and then open with RStudio. If you open the "Usage of the Term Neural Networks.Rmd" file it will have several chunks of annotated code that describe the process through which all the data was collected and also how the data visualizations were made.
